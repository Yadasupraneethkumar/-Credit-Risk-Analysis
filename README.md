Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of financial information to predict the credit risk of customers using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's Credit Risk dataset.

Project Steps
Data Collection

Load the dataset from Kaggle.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handling missing values, encode categorical variables, and ensure data consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing key features and their relationships with credit risk.
Feature Engineering

Preparing features for modeling, including normalization and encoding.
Predictive Modeling

Using a decision tree classifier to predict credit risk.
Model Evaluation

Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
Results and Insights

Summarization of findings and implications for financial risk management.
