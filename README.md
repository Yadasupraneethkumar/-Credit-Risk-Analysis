Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of financial information to predict the credit risk of customers using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's Credit Risk dataset.

Data Acquisition
Downloaded and imported data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, ensuring the dataset's integrity.

Data Understanding
Analyzed dataset structure, identifying key financial features influencing credit risk.

Data Transformation
Converted categorical variables to numerical format using label encoding for effective model input.

Data Normalization
Standardized numerical features to ensure uniform scaling, enhancing model accuracy.

Model Selection and Training
Chose a decision tree classifier based on its interpretability and trained it with financial data.

Validation and Tuning
Used cross-validation to fine-tune model parameters, optimizing predictive performance.

Interpretation of Results
Analyzed decision tree outputs to extract rules and insights on customer creditworthiness.
